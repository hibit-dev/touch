# Touch sensor
Touch sensor (also known as touch button) is widely used to control devices. It detects touch, force or pressure on its surface changing the logic state of the circuit. Actually, it works in very similar way as to buttons. Checkout the wiring and Arduino code implementation to track the current state and the state changes.
